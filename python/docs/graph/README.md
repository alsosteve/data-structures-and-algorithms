# Graph
Implement a Graph Class with the following methods:

* add node
  * Arguments: value
  * Returns: The added node
  * Add a node to the graph
* add edge
  * Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
  * Returns: nothing
  * Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
  * If specified, assign a weight to the edge
  * Both nodes should already be in the Graph
* get nodes
  * Arguments: none
  * Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
* get neighbors
  * Arguments: node
  * Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
    * Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
* size
  * Arguments: none
  * Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

## Approach & Efficiency
I just followed allong the class demo.
