# Graph Breadth First
## Feature Tasks
Implement a breadth-first traversal on a graph.

### Method:
* breadth first
  * Arguments: Node
  * Return: A collection of nodes in the order they were visited.
  * Display the collection

## Examples
### Input
![graph](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-36/graph.PNG)

### Output
`Pandora, Arendelle, Metroville, Monstroplolis, Narnia, Naboo`

## Unit Tests
- return common values in tree

## Stretch Goal
Once youâ€™ve achieved a working solution, define a new method that accepts two nodes as input and uses your traversal algorithm to determine if a path exists between the two nodes.
