# Trees: Breadth First Traversal
## Feature Tasks
Challenge Type: Code Challenge / Algorithm

* Write a function called breadth first
* Arguments: tree
* Return: list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered

## Examples
### Input:
![tree example](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-17/binary-tree.png)

### Output:
`[2,7,5,2,6,9,5,11,4]`

## Unit Tests


## Stretch Goal
None

## Approach & Efficiency
I solved this by using the pseudocode provided in the trees reading notes. It was basically a walk through.
