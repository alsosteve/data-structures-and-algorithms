# Hashmap: Tree Intersection
## Feature Tasks
Find common values in 2 binary trees.

### Method:
Write a function called `tree_intersection` that takes two binary trees as parameters.
Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Examples
### Input
![tree1](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-32/BT1.PNG)
![tree2](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-32/BT2.PNG)
### Output
`100,160,125,175,200,350,500`

## Unit Tests
- return common values in tree

## Stretch Goal
* Describe how you might solve this differently if the parameters were Binary Search Trees.
* What are the potential efficiency differences?
